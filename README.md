# godot-gravity-simulator
**A gravity simulator implemented in Rust and visualized with Godot.**

**!This is still under development!**

There will be multiple algorithms to choose from:
- [X] The direct approach with O(nÂ²)
- [X] The Barnes-Hut-Algorithm with O(n log(n)) (and a parallel version)
- [ ] The Fast-Multipole-Method with O(n)
